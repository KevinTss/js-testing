# js-testing

The purpose of this repo is to explore testing with javascript

## Mocha

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a testing framework widely flexible. We need to install it into our dev dependencies.

Then mocha will search by default a `test` folder to run tests.

In that project, just run `npm t`

## Sinon

[Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) will help us to spy function
